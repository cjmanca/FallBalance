# FallBalance

Ever noticed that you can jump down crazy far when hopping around caldera, but if you slide 2 feet you break your legs? That's because Peak calculates fall damage differently if you jump first vs just dropping down or sliding.

This mod just changes it all to the jump style calculation to do away with the annoying inconsistency of fall damage.
